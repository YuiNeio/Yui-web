## ‚ö†Ô∏è about bots
_For bots, they are not distributed widely, why? Because VIP bots or bots are for sale, if you are interested in joining the Lumine-MD group, and if anyone distributes the SC/Source code of bots in an unauthorized manner, it is not YuiNeoi's responsibility._

## Progaming Languageüíª

Here are the programming languages I use in the YuiNeoi website. With the presence of AI, I can work more freely, and when there are bugs, I can resolve them with the help of AI by searching for information on GitHub about this website. After discovering this website, I revamped everything from the front end to the back end.
